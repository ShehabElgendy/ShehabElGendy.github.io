## Development Guidelines

### Code Conventions
1. **CSS**: 
   - Use CSS custom properties for consistent theming
   - Mobile-first responsive design approach
   - BEM-like class naming where applicable
   - Smooth transitions with cubic-bezier timing

2. **JavaScript**:
   - ES6+ syntax with modern browser support
   - Event delegation for dynamic elements
   - Modular function organization
   - Console logging for debugging mobile issues

3. **HTML**:
   - Semantic markup structure
   - Accessibility considerations (aria-labels, alt text)
   - Meta tags for SEO and social sharing
   - Cache-busting query parameters on assets

### Performance Optimizations
- CSS/JS minification not currently implemented (opportunity for improvement)
- Image optimization needed (current images are large - Digital-Twin.png 2.2MB, light-ball-runner.png 1.2MB, full-portfolio.png 1MB, vr-simulation.png 1.6MB)
- Lazy loading for off-screen content
- Efficient event listeners with proper cleanup
- ✅ **Recently cleaned up**: Removed 72 unused legacy template files (18,625 lines of code)

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox support required
- ES6+ JavaScript features used
- Backdrop-filter requires modern browser support

## Deployment Process

### Current Setup
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages
- **Domain**: ShehabElGendy.github.io
- **Cache Busting**: Manual versioning (v=2025010701)
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics tracking ID: G-95G4Y8NTMR

### Manual Deployment Steps
1. Make changes to files
2. Update cache-busting version numbers in HTML
3. Commit to main branch
4. GitHub Pages automatically deploys

### Recommendations for Improvement
1. Add build process with:
   - CSS/JS minification
   - Image optimization
   - Cache busting automation
2. Implement GitHub Actions for automated deployment
3. Add development server for local testing
4. Consider adding a simple build tool like Vite or Parcel

## Common Maintenance Tasks

### Adding New Projects
1. Add project image to `images/` directory
2. Update portfolio section in `index.html`
3. Follow existing HTML structure for consistency
4. Update any video URLs or external links
5. Test responsive layout on mobile devices

### Updating Styles
1. Modify CSS custom properties in `:root` for global changes
2. Follow existing glassmorphism design patterns
3. Test across different screen sizes
4. Maintain consistent animation timing and easing

### Performance Monitoring
1. Check Google Analytics for user behavior
2. Monitor Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
3. Test mobile performance and loading times
4. Validate HTML and CSS for errors

## Security Considerations
- All external links open in new tabs (`target="_blank"`)
- No user input forms to minimize security risks
- Google Analytics properly configured
- No sensitive data in client-side code

## File Organization Tips for AI Models
- Always read `style.css` to understand the design system before making style changes
- Check `script.js` and `modern-enhancements.js` for existing functionality before adding new features
- The project uses vanilla JavaScript - no frameworks like React/Vue
- Images are directly referenced from the `images/` directory
- All animations use CSS transitions and transforms for performance

## Known Issues & Technical Debt
1. Large image file sizes impact loading performance (4 PNG files: 2.2MB, 1.2MB, 1MB, 1.6MB)
2. No build process for optimization
3. Manual cache busting requires updating version numbers
4. No automated testing or linting setup

## Recent Improvements
- ✅ **Code Cleanup (2025-01-08)**: Removed 72 unused legacy template files including entire `assets/` directory, `elements.html`, `generic.html`, and unused template images
- ✅ **Project Structure**: Streamlined to only essential files
- ✅ **Performance**: Eliminated 18,625 lines of unused code

This documentation should help any AI model understand the project structure, conventions, and requirements before making changes or improvements.
